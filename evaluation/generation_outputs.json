Overview  \nMigraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by moderate to severe, often unilateral, throbbing pain accompanied by nausea, sensitivity to light/sound, and sometimes auras. It is managed through acute treatments for attacks and preventive strategies to reduce frequency.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nMigraine symptoms typically include unilateral, pulsating pain worsened by exertion, along with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or odors. Attacks may last 4 hours to several days and often resolve with sleep. Auras occur in about 25% of patients, presenting as visual disturbances (e.g., scotomata), paresthesias, or speech difficulties. Some patients experience auras without subsequent headache [3].  \n\n- **Pain characteristics**: Unilateral, throbbing, moderate to severe, worsened by physical activity.  \n- **Associated symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, photophobia, sonophobia, osmophobia.  \n- **Aura subtypes**: Visual (e.g., scotomata), sensory (paresthesias starting in one hand), speech disturbances.  \n- **Attack duration**: 4 hours to several days.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nMigraine is thought to involve altered central neuronal processing and activation of the trigeminovascular system, leading to neuropeptide release and pain. Triggers include stress, lifestyle factors (e.g., sleep, diet), and familial aggregation. Certain conditions (e.g., CADASIL, mitochondrial disorders) may mimic migraine with aura but are distinct [1][2].  \n\n- **Underlying mechanisms**: Neurovascular pain syndrome, cortical hyperexcitability, trigeminovascular system activation.  \n- **Triggers**: Stress, sleep disturbances, dietary factors.  \n- **Risk factors**: Familial history (familial aggregation).  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n\n**Acute Management**  \nAcute treatment aims to relieve symptoms during an attack. Options include:  \n- **Medications**: Triptans, dihydroergotamine, antiemetics, analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs) [2].  \n- **Lifestyle interventions**: Rest in a dark, quiet room; hydration; caffeine [1].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nPreventive strategies reduce attack frequency and severity. Approaches include:  \n- **Lifestyle modifications**: Sleep hygiene, dietary adjustments, trigger elimination [1].  \n- **Medications**: Beta-blockers, amitriptyline, topiramate, divalproex [2].  \n- **Patient education**: Headache diary to track patterns and triggers [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Key Terms  \n- **Triptans**: Medications that target serotonin receptors to relieve migraine pain.  \n- **Photophobia**: Sensitivity to light.  \n- **Sonophobia**: Sensitivity to sound.  \n- **Beta-blockers**: Drugs that reduce nerve activity and prevent migraines.  \n- **Auras**: Temporary neurological symptoms (e.g., visual disturbances) preceding or accompanying migraines.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Closing Note  \nSeek medical advice if headaches are severe, sudden, or accompanied by new neurological symptoms.

    "generated_answer": "### 1. Overview  \nParkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder marked by motor symptoms such as tremor, stiffness, and slowed movement. These arise from degeneration of brain pathways involving dopamine-producing neurons. Non-motor symptoms like autonomic instability and mood changes may also occur [3].  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nParkinson’s disease symptoms typically begin unilaterally and progress to both sides of the body. Motor symptoms dominate early, while non-motor issues like autonomic dysfunction and depression often emerge later [3].  \n\n**Specific symptoms include:**  \n- Resting tremor, which diminishes during voluntary movements like finger-to-nose coordination [2].  \n- Muscular rigidity, particularly in axial muscles, leading to gait instability [1].  \n- Bradykinesia (slow, decreased movement) affecting daily activities [3].  \n- Postural instability increasing fall risk [3].  \n- Dystonias (involuntary muscle contractions) and autonomic instability (e.g., blood pressure fluctuations) [2].  \n- Depression, personality changes, and reduced reflexes during neurological exams [2].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nThe exact cause is unknown, but Parkinson’s disease involves degeneration of neuronal pathways between the striatum and neocortex. Abnormal accumulation of synuclein protein forms Lewy bodies in brain regions like the substantia nigra, disrupting dopamine production [3].  \n\n**Key factors include:**  \n- Genetic and environmental influences (not explicitly detailed in context).  \n- Age: Most cases begin after age 40, with prevalence increasing sharply over 65 [3].  \n- Synuclein misfolding and Lewy body formation in neurons [3].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n**Acute Management**  \nAcute symptoms are managed with medications to replenish dopamine or mimic its effects. Surgery may address severe, drug-resistant cases.  \n\n**Medications/interventions:**  \n- Levodopa combined with carbidopa to reduce side effects [3].  \n- Tolcapone, a COMT inhibitor, though less commonly used due to liver risks [5].  \n- Deep brain stimulation for advanced cases with dyskinesias or motor fluctuations [5].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term strategies focus on slowing progression and maintaining function through lifestyle and adaptive measures.  \n\n**Approaches:**  \n- Physical therapy and regular exercise to preserve mobility [5].  \n- Occupational therapy to modify home environments (e.g., grab bars) [5].  \n- Adaptive strategies for daily activities to maximize independence [5].  \n\n---\n\n### 5.

    "generated_answer": "### 1. Overview  \nDiabetes mellitus is managed through a combination of lifestyle adjustments, medications, and monitoring to control blood glucose levels and prevent complications. Treatment varies by type: insulin is essential for type 1 diabetes, while type 2 diabetes may involve oral drugs, insulin, or both. Key goals include maintaining stable glucose levels and minimizing risks like vascular disease or neuropathy [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nEarly symptoms of diabetes include excessive thirst (polydipsia), hunger (polyphagia), and frequent urination (polyuria) due to hyperglycemia. Later complications involve vascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, and increased infection risk [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nDiabetes arises from impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance, leading to elevated blood glucose. Type 1 diabetes involves autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells, while type 2 diabetes combines insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle [1].  \n\n- Impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance [1]  \n- Type 1 diabetes (autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells) [1]  \n- Type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency) [1]  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n\n**Acute Management**  \nDuring hyperglycemic episodes, treatment focuses on rapid glucose control. Insulin therapy is critical for type 1 diabetes, while type 2 diabetes may use rapid-acting insulin or oral antihyperglycemics. Blood glucose monitoring guides adjustments to prevent hypoglycemia [1][5].  \n\n- Insulin administration for type 1 diabetes [1]  \n- Oral antihyperglycemics or insulin for type 2 diabetes [1]  \n- Home glucose monitoring to adjust treatment [5]  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term strategies aim to stabilize glucose levels and reduce complications. Diet and exercise form the foundation, supplemented by medications like ACE inhibitors, statins, and aspirin to address cardiovascular risks. Glycemic targets include fasting glucose <95 mg/dL and postprandial levels ≤120 mg/dL [1][3][5].  \n\n- Diet adjustments (low saturated fat, moderate carbohydrates) [3]  \n- Regular physical activity [1]  \n- Oral antihyperglycemics or insulin for type 2 diabetes [1]  \n- ACE inhibitors, statins, and aspirin to prevent complications [5]  \n- Glycemic targets: HbA1c <7% [5]  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Medical Terms  \n- **Hyperglycemia**: High blood sugar levels due to insulin deficiency or resistance [1].  \n- **Insulin resistance**: Reduced cellular response to insulin, impairing glucose uptake [1].  \n- **HbA1c**: A blood test measuring average glucose levels over 2–3 months [5].  \n- **Polydipsia**: Excessive thirst linked to high glucose levels [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Closing Note  \nPatients should consult healthcare providers regularly to adjust treatment plans and monitor complications. Consistent glucose control significantly impacts long-term outcomes, especially in preventing vascular and neuropathic damage [1][5].",

These symptoms arise from dysfunction in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra [3].  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nThe symptom pattern includes a resting tremor that diminishes with movement, muscle rigidity with a ratchet-like quality (cogwheel rigidity), and slowed, reduced movements (bradykinesia). Additional features may include a masklike facial expression, hypophonic speech, and difficulty initiating movements [1].  \n\n**Specific symptoms:**  \n- Resting tremor maximal at rest, lessening during activity, and absent during sleep [1].  \n- Pill-rolling tremor involving the wrist and fingers [1].  \n- Cogwheel rigidity with sudden, rhythmic jerks during joint movement [1].  \n- Bradykinesia and hypokinesia (slow, reduced movements) [1].  \n- Masklike facial expression, drooling, and reduced blinking [1].  \n- Hypophonic speech with a monotone quality [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nThe condition results from degeneration of the basal ganglia and substantia nigra, disrupting motor coordination pathways. Neural lesions in the extrapyramidal system are central to movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease [3].  \n\n**Distinct causes or risk factors:**  \n- Degeneration of the basal ganglia (caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra) [3].  \n- Unknown etiology in most cases, though neuronal degeneration in specific brain regions determines symptom presentation [5].  \n\n---\n\n### 4.

    "generated_answer": "---\n\n### 1. Overview  \nLiver disease disrupts the clotting cascade by impairing the liver’s ability to produce clotting factors, leading to prolonged clotting times and bleeding risks. Severe liver dysfunction also reduces synthesis of proteins like α-antiplasmin, increasing fibrinolysis and further promoting bleeding [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nBleeding in liver disease often presents with laboratory abnormalities rather than overt symptoms initially. Patients may develop easy bruising, nosebleeds, or gastrointestinal bleeding as clotting factor deficiencies worsen.  \n\n- **Prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR)** due to reduced clotting factor synthesis [1].  \n- **Elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT)** for the same reason [1].  \n- **Thrombocytopenia** (low platelet count) from splenic sequestration or decreased platelet production [4].  \n- **Decreased fibrinogen levels** in severe cases, contributing to impaired clot formation [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nLiver disease disrupts hemostasis primarily by failing to synthesize clotting factors and regulatory proteins. Additional mechanisms include excessive fibrinolysis and platelet dysfunction.  \n\n- Impaired synthesis of all coagulation factors in the liver [1].  \n- Reduced production of **α-antiplasmin**, leading to uncontrolled fibrinolysis and bleeding [1].  \n- **Thrombocytopenia** from splenic sequestration or decreased hepatic production of thrombopoietin [4].  \n- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)** in advanced liver failure, causing consumption of clotting factors and platelets [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n\n**Acute Management**  \nSevere bleeding requires immediate replacement of deficient clotting components.  \n\n- **Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)** to replenish clotting factors [3].  \n- **Platelet concentrates** for thrombocytopenia [3].  \n- **Cryoprecipitate** to replace fibrinogen and factor VIII [3].  \n- **Heparin** in specific cases of DIC to interrupt pathological clotting [3].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term strategies focus on addressing the underlying liver disease.  \n\n- Treating the root cause (e.g., alcohol cessation, managing cirrhosis) [1].  \n- Monitoring and managing vitamin K deficiency if present [1].  \n- Avoiding medications that exacerbate bleeding risk (e.g., NSAIDs).  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Key Terms  \n- **PT/INR**: Blood tests measuring how long it takes blood to clot; prolonged in clotting factor deficiencies [1].  \n- **PTT**: Test for clotting time; elevated when clotting factors are low [1].  \n- **Thrombocytopenia**: Low platelet count, increasing bleeding risk [4].  \n- **Fibrinolysis**: Breakdown of blood clots; excessive in liver disease due to α-antiplasmin deficiency [1].  \n- **DIC**: A condition where clots form throughout the body, depleting clotting factors and causing bleeding [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 6.

    "generated_answer": "### 1. Overview  \nAngina pectoris and acute myocardial ischemia both involve chest discomfort due to reduced heart blood flow, but they differ in symptom patterns, triggers, and diagnostic features. Angina typically occurs predictably with exertion or stress and resolves at rest, while acute ischemia presents with more severe, prolonged symptoms and may indicate imminent heart damage.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nAngina pectoris is characterized by chest discomfort triggered by physical or emotional stress, often relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Acute myocardial ischemia presents with more intense, prolonged chest pain, sometimes at rest, and may include radiating discomfort, shortness of breath, or sweating.  \n\n- **Angina pectoris**:  \n  - Chest discomfort beneath the sternum, radiating to the left arm, shoulder, jaw, or back [4].  \n  - Symptoms vary from mild ache to severe crushing sensation but are rarely described as sharp pain [4].  \n  - Typically resolves within minutes of rest or nitroglycerin use [1].  \n  - May follow a crescendo pattern (increasing frequency/severity) [5].  \n\n- **Acute myocardial ischemia**:  \n  - Sudden, severe chest pain lasting >20 minutes, often unrelieved by rest or nitroglycerin [3].  \n  - May include dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, or syncope [3].  \n  - ECG shows ST-segment elevation (STEMI) or non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) with biomarker elevation [3].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nAngina pectoris results from reduced coronary blood flow due to microvascular dysfunction, epicardial spasm, or atherosclerosis. Acute myocardial ischemia arises from sudden plaque rupture, thrombosis, or severe coronary occlusion.  \n\n- **Angina pectoris**:  \n  - Microvascular dysfunction (impaired dilation during stress) [1].  \n  - Epicardial coronary spasm or atherosclerosis [1].  \n  - Increased myocardial oxygen demand (e.g., exertion, stress) [4].  \n\n- **Acute myocardial ischemia**:  \n  - Plaque rupture with thrombus formation [3].  \n  - Coronary artery embolism or severe stenosis [1].  \n  - Sudden increases in oxygen demand (e.g., hypertension, tachycardia) [5].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n**Acute Management**  \nAngina during an attack is managed with rest and sublingual nitroglycerin. Acute ischemia requires immediate interventions to restore blood flow.  \n\n- **Angina pectoris**:  \n  - Sublingual nitroglycerin [1].  \n  - Oxygen therapy if hypoxic [not explicitly stated, but inferred from context].  \n\n- **Acute myocardial ischemia**:  \n  - Aspirin and antiplatelet agents [not explicitly stated, but implied by context].  \n  - Reperfusion therapy (e.g., percutaneous coronary intervention) for STEMI [3].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term strategies aim to reduce ischemia triggers and stabilize coronary disease.  \n\n- **Angina pectoris**:  \n  - Beta-blockers to reduce myocardial oxygen demand [1].  \n  - Lifestyle modifications (e.g., exercise, weight loss) [not explicitly stated].  \n\n- **Acute myocardial ischemia**:  \n  - Antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy [not explicitly stated].  \n  - Coronary revascularization (angioplasty or bypass) [not explicitly stated].  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Medical Terms  \n- **Angina pectoris**: Chest discomfort from reduced heart blood flow, often triggered by exertion.  \n- **Acute myocardial ischemia**: Sudden reduction in heart blood flow, risking tissue damage.  \n- **ST-segment elevation**: ECG change indicating full-thickness heart muscle injury.  \n- **Microvascular dysfunction**: Impaired small coronary artery dilation during stress.  \n\n---\n\n### 6.

This condition arises due to impaired glucose metabolism caused by thiamin deficiency, compounded by genetic defects in transketolase, an enzyme critical for thiamin processing [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nSymptoms of Wernicke’s encephalopathy appear suddenly and involve central nervous system dysfunction. Key features include oculomotor abnormalities (e.g., horizontal/vertical nystagmus, partial ophthalmoplegias like lateral rectus palsy), abnormal pupils (sluggish or unequal), and altered mental status. These manifestations stem from symmetric brain lesions around ventricles and specific nuclei [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nThe mechanism involves thiamin deficiency combined with sudden carbohydrate intake, which overwhelms the body’s metabolic capacity. Genetic abnormalities in transketolase, an enzyme that processes thiamin, further impair thiamin utilization, increasing susceptibility [1].  \n\n**Distinct causes or risk factors:**  \n- Thiamin deficiency from prolonged undernutrition (e.g., starvation, gastric plication, AIDS, cancer) [1].  \n- Genetic defects in transketolase [1].  \n- Rapid refeeding with IV dextrose in high-risk patients [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n#### Acute Management  \nAcute treatment focuses on stabilizing metabolic imbalances and preventing neurological damage. Key interventions include:  \n- Administering thiamin supplements before or alongside carbohydrate refeeding [1].  \n- Correcting electrolyte imbalances (e.g., phosphate, potassium, magnesium) through IV solutions [5].  \n\n#### Preventive Management  \nPreventive strategies aim to avoid refeeding syndrome by carefully managing nutritional reintroduction. Approaches include:  \n- Gradual nutrient replenishment, starting with oral intake if possible [5].  \n- Monitoring for signs of thiamin deficiency during refeeding [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 5.

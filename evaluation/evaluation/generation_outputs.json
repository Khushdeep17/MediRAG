It primarily affects movement control and balance, with symptoms worsening over time.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nParkinson’s disease symptoms include a combination of motor impairments that typically develop gradually. Key features involve resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability, which distinguish it from other movement disorders.  \n\n- Resting tremor, often unilateral (affecting one side of the body) [3].  \n- Muscular rigidity, leading to stiffness and resistance during passive movement [3].  \n- Bradykinesia (slow and decreased movement), impacting daily activities like walking or writing [3].  \n- Postural instability, increasing the risk of falls due to impaired balance [4].  \n- Tremor may attenuate or disappear during tasks like finger-to-nose coordination testing [2].  \n- Difficulty performing rapid, alternating movements (e.g., finger tapping) [2].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nThe exact cause of Parkinson’s disease is unknown, but it involves degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to disrupted motor control. Abnormal accumulation of synuclein protein in Lewy bodies is implicated in some cases [3].  \n\n- Degeneration of neuronal pathways in the striatum and neocortex [1].  \n- Presence of Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra [1].  \n- Synuclein protein forming insoluble fibrils in affected brain regions [3].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n**Acute Management**  \nAcute symptoms are managed with medications to alleviate motor dysfunction. Levodopa combined with carbidopa is the most effective treatment for symptom relief [5].  \n\n- Levodopa plus carbidopa to replenish dopamine levels [5].  \n- Deep brain stimulation for advanced cases unresponsive to drugs [5].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term strategies focus on slowing progression and managing complications. Lifestyle modifications and surgical interventions may be used alongside medications.  \n\n- Regular physical activity and occupational therapy to maintain mobility [5].  \n- Adjusting medication regimens to minimize side effects like dyskinesias [5].  \n\n---\n\n### 5.

    "generated_answer": "### 1. Overview  \nDiabetes mellitus is managed through a combination of lifestyle adjustments, medications, and monitoring to control blood glucose levels and prevent complications. Treatment varies by type: Type 1 diabetes requires insulin, while Type 2 diabetes may involve oral medications, insulin, or both. Goals include maintaining stable glucose levels and reducing risks like vascular disease or neuropathy [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nEarly symptoms of diabetes are linked to high blood sugar and include excessive thirst (polydipsia), hunger (polyphagia), and frequent urination (polyuria). Long-term complications involve vascular damage, nerve issues (peripheral neuropathy), and increased infection risks [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nDiabetes results from impaired insulin secretion and varying degrees of insulin resistance, leading to elevated blood glucose. This disrupts normal glucose metabolism and causes hyperglycemia [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n\n**Acute Management**  \nDuring active hyperglycemic episodes, treatment focuses on immediate glucose control. Key strategies include:  \n- **Home blood glucose monitoring** to adjust treatment [5].  \n- **Insulin administration** for Type 1 diabetes, with dosing matched to carbohydrate intake (e.g., 1 unit of rapid-acting insulin per 15g of carbohydrates) [3].  \n- **Oral antihyperglycemic drugs** for Type 2 diabetes to lower glucose levels [1].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term strategies aim to reduce complication risks and stabilize glucose levels:  \n- **Dietary adjustments**: Low saturated fat, moderate carbohydrates (preferably whole grains), and individualized meal planning [3].  \n- **Exercise and weight management** to improve insulin sensitivity [1].  \n- **Medications**: ACE inhibitors, statins, and aspirin to prevent vascular complications [5].  \n- **Regular monitoring**: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels <7% and blood glucose targets (80–120 mg/dL during the day, 100–140 mg/dL at bedtime) [5].  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Medical Terms  \n- **Hyperglycemia**: High blood sugar levels.  \n- **Insulin resistance**: Reduced sensitivity to insulin, impairing glucose uptake.  \n- **Polydipsia**: Excessive thirst.  \n- **HbA1c**: A blood test measuring average glucose levels over 2–3 months.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Closing Note  \nPatients should seek medical advice if symptoms worsen or complications arise. Consistent glucose monitoring, adherence to treatment plans, and regular healthcare provider visits are critical for optimal outcomes [1][5].",

Smoking increases ulcer risk and recurrence. Treatment focuses on eradicating H. pylori, reducing acid production, and addressing lifestyle factors.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nPeptic ulcers often present with pain in the upper abdomen, which may worsen between meals or at night. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, bloating, and weight loss. Severe complications like bleeding or perforation can cause vomiting blood, black tarry stools, or sudden abdominal pain.  \n\n- Recurrent, large-volume vomiting, especially late in the day, suggests gastric outlet obstruction [2].  \n- Hematemesis (vomiting blood) or melena (black stools) indicates bleeding [3].  \n- Sharp, sudden abdominal pain may signal perforation [3].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nPeptic ulcers develop when the stomach lining’s defenses are compromised, often due to H. pylori infection or NSAID use. These factors disrupt mucosal repair and increase susceptibility to acid. Smoking and, rarely, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrin-secreting tumors) also contribute.  \n\n- *H. pylori* infection is present in 50–70% of duodenal ulcers and 30–50% of gastric ulcers [1].  \n- NSAIDs account for >50% of peptic ulcers [1].  \n- Smoking increases ulcer recurrence and delays healing [1].  \n- Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is suspected in ulcers with atypical locations or multiple lesions [3].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n\n**Acute Management**  \nAcute treatment targets pain relief, bleeding control, and perforation repair. Acid suppression and H. pylori eradication are critical.  \n\n- Eradication of *H. pylori* reduces recurrence to 10%, compared with 70% recurrence with acid suppression alone [1].  \n- Acid-suppressing medications (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) are used during active ulcers [1].  \n- Surgery is required for perforation or uncontrolled bleeding [2].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term strategies focus on preventing recurrence by addressing root causes and risk factors.  \n\n- Eradication of *H. pylori* with antibiotic therapy [1].  \n- Avoidance of NSAIDs or use of proton pump inhibitors with NSAID therapy [1].  \n- Smoking cessation to reduce recurrence risk [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Key Terms  \n- **H. pylori**: A bacterium that infects the stomach and contributes to ulcers.  \n- **NSAIDs**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen) that can damage the stomach lining.  \n- **Melena**: Black, tarry stools indicating digested blood.  \n- **Perforation**: A hole in the stomach or intestinal wall, often requiring emergency surgery.  \n\n---\n\n### 6.

Overview  \nThe patient’s recurring severe headaches with nausea and light sensitivity are consistent with **migraine**, a primary headache disorder characterized by moderate-to-severe unilateral or bilateral throbbing pain, often accompanied by nausea, photophobia, and sonophobia [1]. Attacks typically resolve with rest and sleep, and symptoms may disrupt daily activities [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nMigraine symptoms include severe, pulsating headaches often localized to the frontotemporal region, though they may be unilateral or bilateral. Associated features such as nausea (with or without vomiting), sensitivity to light (photophobia), and sensitivity to sound (sonophobia) are prominent [1]. Patients often report difficulty concentrating during attacks and may seek relief by resting in dark, quiet environments [1]. Some experience auras—such as visual disturbances (e.g., scotomata) or sensory symptoms (e.g., paresthesias)—though these occur in only 25% of cases [1].  \n\n- **Key symptom pattern**: Unilateral or bilateral throbbing pain, moderate-to-severe intensity, lasting 4 hours to several days.  \n- **Associated symptoms**: Nausea, photophobia, sonophobia, and difficulty with routine physical activity.  \n- **Aura subtypes**: Visual auras (e.g., scotomata) or sensory auras (e.g., paresthesias marching to the arm and face) may precede or accompany the headache [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nMigraine is a neurovascular pain syndrome involving altered central neuronal processing and activation of the trigeminovascular system, leading to neuropeptide release and vascular changes [5]. Triggers include genetic factors (familial aggregation), cortical hyperexcitability, and environmental influences (e.g., sleep patterns, diet) [5].  \n\n- **Underlying mechanisms**: Neurovascular pain syndrome with central nervous system hyperexcitability and trigeminovascular system activation [5].  \n- **Risk factors**: Family history, puberty/young adulthood onset, and fluctuating frequency/severity over decades [5].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n\n**Acute Management**  \nAcute treatment aims to relieve symptoms during an active attack. First-line strategies include rest in a dark, quiet environment and over-the-counter analgesics for mild cases [1]. For moderate-to-severe attacks, specific therapies are used:  \n\n- **Medications**: Triptans, dihydroergotamine, antiemetics (e.g., for nausea), and analgesics [5].  \n- **Non-pharmacologic**: Hydration and recumbency (lying down) [2].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term strategies reduce attack frequency and severity. Approaches include lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapies:  \n\n- **Lifestyle changes**: Regular sleep patterns, dietary adjustments, and avoiding known triggers [5].  \n- **Medications**: Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol), amitriptyline, topiramate, or divalproex [5].  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Key Terms  \n- **Migraine**: A primary headache disorder with severe, throbbing pain and associated symptoms like nausea and light sensitivity.  \n- **Photophobia**: Sensitivity to light, a common feature of migraine.  \n- **Triptans**: Medications (e.g., sumatriptan) that target serotonin receptors to relieve migraine symptoms.  \n- **Auras**: Transient neurological symptoms (e.g., visual disturbances) that precede or accompany some migraines.  \n\n---\n\n### 6.

It is characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which are hallmark motor symptoms of the disorder [2].  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nThe symptom pattern involves a combination of resting tremor, muscle rigidity, and slowed voluntary movements. These features progressively impair motor function and facial expression.  \n\n- **Resting tremor**: Maximal at rest, decreases with movement, and often presents as a \"pill-rolling\" motion of the fingers [1].  \n- **Rigidity**: Sustained muscle stiffness with a \"cogwheel\" quality when a clinician moves a joint [1].  \n- **Bradykinesia**: Slowness of movement, often accompanied by difficulty initiating actions and reduced amplitude of movements [1].  \n- **Hypokinesia**: Decreased overall movement, contributing to a \"masklike\" facial expression and reduced blinking [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nThe condition arises from dysfunction in the extrapyramidal system, particularly the basal ganglia and substantia nigra. Degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons disrupts motor coordination pathways [3].  \n\n- **Neuroanatomical basis**: Lesions in the basal ganglia (caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra) [3].  \n- **Neurochemical basis**: Loss of dopaminergic signaling in the extrapyramidal system [3].  \n- **Progressive degeneration**: Neuronal atrophy in brain regions controlling movement [5].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n**Acute Management**  \nAcute management focuses on symptom relief during episodes of motor dysfunction.  \n\n- **Levodopa**: A dopamine precursor to replenish depleted neurotransmitter levels [2].  \n- **Dopamine agonists**: Mimic dopamine activity to improve movement [2].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term strategies aim to slow disease progression and manage complications.  \n\n- **Physical therapy**: Exercises to maintain mobility and reduce stiffness [2].  \n- **Medication adjustments**: Regular monitoring and optimization of dopaminergic therapy [2].  \n- **Lifestyle modifications**: Addressing fatigue and emotional tension, which exacerbate symptoms [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Key Terms  \n- **Bradykinesia**: Slowness of movement.  \n- **Rigidity**: Sustained muscle stiffness.  \n- **Resting tremor**: Tremor that occurs at rest and diminishes with voluntary movement.  \n- **Cogwheel rigidity**: Rhythmic resistance felt when moving a rigid joint.  \n\n---\n\n### 6.

Risk factors include poor sanitation, crowded living conditions, and improper endoscope disinfection [2].  \n\n- **Primary cause**: *H. pylori* infection.  \n- **Transmission routes**: Oral-oral or fecal-oral.  \n- **Risk factors**: Family clusters, custodial institutions, improper endoscope disinfection [2].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n\n**Acute Management**  \nAcute treatment focuses on eradicating *H. pylori* to prevent complications. The standard regimen combines a PPI with two antibiotics.  \n\n- **Triple therapy**:  \n  - Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) + amoxicillin 500 mg twice daily + clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily or metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 14 days [4].  \n  - Ranitidine bismuth citrate may substitute for PPI in some cases [4].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term prevention involves acid suppression and monitoring for recurrence. Patients with ulcers require continued acid suppression for at least 4 weeks post-treatment [4].  \n\n- **Acid suppression**: Proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers for symptom control [1].  \n- **Repeat testing**: Urea breath tests or stool antigen assays to confirm eradication after therapy [5].  \n- **Repeat treatment**: If two courses fail, endoscopy with culture and sensitivity testing is recommended [4].  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Key Terms  \n- **Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)**: Medication that reduces stomach acid production.  \n- **Dyspepsia**: Upset stomach or indigestion.  \n- **Endoscopy**: Procedure using a flexible tube to examine the stomach.  \n- **Urea breath test**: Diagnostic test for *H. pylori* by detecting bacterial metabolism of labeled urea.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Closing Note  \nPatients should seek medical advice if symptoms persist after treatment or if complications like bleeding or severe pain arise. Outcomes depend on adherence to therapy and timely follow-up testing [4].",

Lithium and iodine-containing compounds like amiodarone are explicitly cited as causes of thyroid dysfunction in the provided context [1][5].  \n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nSymptoms of medication-induced thyroid dysfunction include decreased thyroid hormone production, leading to hypothyroidism. Patients may develop goiter due to compensatory TSH elevation. Specific manifestations depend on the drug’s mechanism but generally align with hypothyroidism or nonthyroidal illness syndrome.  \n\n- **Hypothyroidism symptoms**: Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance [5].  \n- **Goiter**: Enlarged thyroid gland, potentially with nodules [5].  \n- **Nonthyroidal illness syndrome**: Normal clinical euthyroid state despite abnormal thyroid tests (e.g., low T3, elevated reverse T3) [3].  \n\n### 3. Causes  \nMedications impair thyroid function by directly inhibiting hormone synthesis or altering TSH regulation. Lithium and iodine-containing drugs disrupt thyroid hormone production pathways. The exact mechanisms for some drugs remain unclear, but systemic effects on peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 are implicated in nonthyroidal illness [3][5].  \n\n- **Lithium**: Decreases thyroid hormone synthesis and increases hypothyroidism risk [4][5].  \n- **Amiodarone/iodine-containing compounds**: Reduce thyroid hormone synthesis [5].  \n- **Nonthyroidal illness**: Proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1) may alter thyroid hormone metabolism [3].  \n\n### 4.

    "generated_answer": "### 1. Overview  \nAngina pectoris and acute myocardial ischemia both involve chest discomfort due to reduced heart blood flow, but they differ in symptom duration, ECG findings, and diagnostic markers. Angina typically resolves with rest or nitroglycerin and may show nonspecific ECG changes, while acute myocardial ischemia often presents with persistent severe pain, ST-segment elevation on ECG, and elevated cardiac biomarkers [1][3].  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nAngina pectoris involves chest discomfort triggered by exertion or stress, often described as a crushing sensation, and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Discomfort may radiate to the left arm, jaw, or back [4]. Acute myocardial ischemia presents with severe, unrelenting chest pain, sometimes without typical angina features, and may include shortness of breath or diaphoresis [3].  \n\n- **Angina pectoris**:  \n  - Chest discomfort beneath the sternum, radiating to the left arm, jaw, or back [4].  \n  - Pain relieved by rest or nitroglycerin [1].  \n  - May occur at rest (angina decubitus) or during exertion [5].  \n- **Acute myocardial ischemia**:  \n  - Severe, persistent chest pain not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin [3].  \n  - May include dyspnea, diaphoresis, or nausea [3].  \n  - Nocturnal angina with crescendo frequency may signal worsening ischemia [5].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nAngina pectoris arises from microvascular dysfunction, coronary constriction, or reduced coronary flow reserve, often without obstructive atherosclerosis [1]. Acute myocardial ischemia results from plaque rupture, thrombus formation, or severe epicardial coronary artery spasm, leading to transmural myocardial injury [3].  \n\n- **Angina pectoris**:  \n  - Microvascular dysfunction within the myocardium [1].  \n  - Reflex intramyocardial coronary constriction [1].  \n- **Acute myocardial ischemia**:  \n  - Plaque rupture with thrombus formation [3].  \n  - Epicardial coronary spasm or embolism [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n\n**Acute Management**  \nAngina during an attack is treated with rest, sublingual nitroglycerin, and oxygen. ECG monitoring is critical to detect reversible ischemic changes like ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion [2].  \n\n- Nitroglycerin sublingual or intravenous [2].  \n- Oxygen therapy to improve myocardial oxygenation [4].  \n- Aspirin if acute coronary syndrome is suspected [3].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term strategies focus on reducing ischemia triggers and improving coronary flow. Beta-blockers are first-line for angina, while lifestyle modifications address risk factors [1].  \n\n- Beta-blockers to reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand [1].  \n- Statins and antiplatelet agents to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques [3].  \n- Exercise training and dietary changes to manage metabolic syndrome [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Medical Terms  \n- **Angina pectoris**: Chest discomfort caused by reduced heart blood flow, often triggered by exertion.  \n- **Acute myocardial ischemia**: Sudden severe reduction in heart blood flow, leading to tissue injury.  \n- **ST-segment elevation**: ECG finding indicating transmural myocardial injury.  \n- **Microvascular dysfunction**: Impaired dilation of small coronary vessels within the heart muscle.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Closing Note  \nSeek immediate medical attention for persistent chest pain unrelieved by rest or nitroglycerin, as this may indicate acute myocardial ischemia. Prognosis for angina is generally good with treatment, but untreated ischemia can progress to heart attack [1][3].",

This can trigger Wernicke’s encephalopathy, a neurological condition linked to sudden metabolic shifts and impaired thiamin-dependent enzyme function [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Symptoms  \nSymptoms of Wernicke’s encephalopathy appear suddenly and involve the central nervous system. Key features include:  \n- Oculomotor abnormalities (horizontal/vertical nystagmus, partial ophthalmoplegia, e.g., lateral rectus palsy) [1].  \n- Sluggish or unequal pupils [1].  \n- Altered mental status or ataxia (not explicitly detailed in context but implied by CNS involvement).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Causes  \nThe mechanism involves thiamin deficiency and abrupt carbohydrate loading, which disrupts energy metabolism. Key causes include:  \n- Thiamin deficiency from prolonged undernutrition (e.g., starvation, gastric plication, AIDS, cancer) [1].  \n- Rapid refeeding with IV dextrose or oral carbohydrates in high-risk patients [1].  \n- Genetic defects in transketolase, an enzyme critical for thiamin processing [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment  \n**Acute Management**  \nImmediate intervention focuses on preventing or treating Wernicke’s encephalopathy:  \n- Administer thiamin supplementation before or alongside refeeding [1].  \n- Avoid IV dextrose in high-risk patients until thiamin levels are stabilized [1].  \n\n**Preventive Management**  \nLong-term strategies aim to address underlying nutritional deficits:  \n- Gradual nutrient replenishment, prioritizing oral intake if feasible [5].  \n- Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances before initiating refeeding [5].  \n- Monitor for thiamin deficiency in patients with chronic undernutrition (e.g., AIDS, cancer) [1].  \n\n---\n\n### 5.
